## Project description

Mobile apps are everywhere. They are easy to create and can be lucrative. Because of these two factors, more and more apps are being developed. 
In this notebook, we will do a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories. 
I'll look for insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention.

## Project Tasks

1. Import Google Play Store apps and reviews
2. Data cleaning
3. Correcting data types
4. Exploring app categories
5. Distribution of app ratings
6. Size and price of an app
7. Relation between app category and app price
8. Filter out "junk" apps
9. Popularity of paid apps vs free apps
10. Sentiment analysis of user reviews

## Dataset

* apps.csv: contains all the details of the applications on Google Play. There are 13 features that describe a given app.
* user_reviews.csv: contains 100 reviews for each app, most helpful first. The text in each review has been pre-processed and attributed with three new features: Sentiment (Positive, Negative or Neutral), Sentiment Polarity and Sentiment Subjectivity.

### Notes

The dataset was downloaded from Kanggle, and the project tasks were provided by Datacamp.
