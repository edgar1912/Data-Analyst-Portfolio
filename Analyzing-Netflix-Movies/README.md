Technology: Python

Topics covered in the project:

## Project description

In this project I will discover if Netflix's movies are getting shorter over time. As evidence of this, Datacamp have provided us with the following information. 
For the years from 2011 to 2020, the average movie durations are 103, 101, 99, 100, 100, 95, 95, 96, 93, and 90, respectively.

## Tasks for the project

1. Loading data into a dictionary
2. Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary
3. A visual inspection of our data
4. Loading the rest of the data from a CSV
5. Filtering for movies
6. Creating a scatter plot
7. Marking non-feature films
8. Plotting with color
